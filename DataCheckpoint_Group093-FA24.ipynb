    "Throughout history, music has played an important role in the creative expression of disadvantaged communities. We want to gain a greater insight of this relationship using exploratory data analysis. After doing some research, what we currently know is that groups fighting for liberation often turned to the rap and R&B genres and wrote songs about their struggles, especially throughout the civil rights movement. In more recent decades, we have seen increased political expression in other genres, such as pop and singer-songwrier. We want to find out if these genres and other music variables have a correlation with political affiliation over time by state.\n",

    "Past research has shown that people's music preferences can help denote their political affiliation. Specifically, republicans typically prefer country music and democrats typically prefer pop, rap, hip-hop, classic rock, and/or alternative music. Additionally, democrats are less likely to prefer country music.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-3) Further studies delve into the relationship between music preferences, partisanship, and political attitudes. Historically, there has been a connection between music and political affiliation, where music often has an influence and reflected political events. Using an original survey for newer findings, the study again found that Republicans are more likely to prefer Country music, while Democrats tend to more Classic Rock and Alternative genres. These preferences were found to influence the person's political attitudes, where Republicans preferring New Country, shows more favored opinions of Republican Congressmen and the Supreme Court. These findings show that political identities can be strengthened with music preferences through Affective polarization.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3) This is relevant to our project because this research showcases a clear correlation between music genre and political party.

    "The Kaggle dataset we are using analyzes US election results from 1976-2020, based on U.S. states, districts, and on the national level. We assume that since these election results are public nationwide that there wouldn’t be problems with the privacy/terms of use of this data. However, the data itself can have bias since voter turnout has varied from year-to-year, which doesn’t account for the public opinion of everyone in a certain state. Generally, more voter turnout has resulted in elections that were more high-stakes compared to other elections. As well, there are laws that prevent certain demographics from voting: for instance, non-citizens, including legal residents, convicted felons, and some with a mental disability cannot vote based on different states. \n",

    "The Spotify dataset was made using Spotify’s web API, and does not rely on the data of their individual users’ listening activity in a way it breaches their personal privacy. However, Spotify wasn’t launched in the U.S. until 2011, and after the trial period ended in January 2012 users were limited to ten hours of streaming per month. We cannot analyze the relationship of music preference and U.S. political preference based on Spotify alone for years before 2011 because of this reason. To answer our research question with best accuracy, we must analyze Spotify listening trends from 2011 and beyond in relation to U.S. election results to show a more direct correlation."

    "If you think you will need any special resources or training outside what we have covered in COGS 108 to solve your problem, then your proposal should state these clearly. For example, if you have selected a problem that involves implementing multiple neural networks, please state this so we can make sure you know what you’re doing and so we can point you to resources you will need to implement your project. Note that you are not required to use outside methods.\n",
